## How to use this repository

1. Fork this repository to create a local copy in your github account. Do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the [repository home page](https://github.com/environmental-data-science/eds217_2023/).

1. Clone the forked repository to your local computer

	* Open your `Terminal`.

	* Type `git clone` and the the url for your forked copy of this repository, which is `https://github.com/<your username>/eds217_2023`, where <your username> is your github user id.

	     The entire command will look like this:

		`$ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/eds217_2023`

		**Note:** In the line above, the `$` is your terminal prompt. On other systems, the command prompt is something like `>`, or `[username]$`. To keep these directions more general, I will just use `$` to represent the command prompt throughout our docs. The key point is that you *don't* need to type this as part of the command.

	* Press **Enter**. A local clone of the class repository will be created on your local computer.

		```
		$ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/eds217_2023
		> Cloning into eds217_2023...
		> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
		> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
		> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
		> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
		```

	     You will now have a new local directory in your instance called `eds217_2023/`, which contains all of the course materials. We will download and practice using all of the required software to use these course materials on Day 0 of the course.
